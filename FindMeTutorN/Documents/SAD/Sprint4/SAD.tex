\section{\textbf{Introduction}}
%\begin{flushleft}
\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of a Software Architecture Document(SAD) is to provide a comprehensive architectural overview of the FindMeTutor system. It presents a number of different architectural views which depict different aspects of the system. It is intended to capture and depict the different architectural decisions that have been made by the development team.

\subsection{Scope}
The scope of the SAD is to depict the architecture of the FindMeTutor system. This includes the FindMeTutor Tutor Application, FindMeTutor Student Application and the backend system that allows FindMeTutor to operate.

\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations}
UML: Unified Modeling Language\\
SAD: Software Architecture Document\\

\subsection{Overview}
This document provides the reader with a deeper understanding of the FindMeTutor system. It is organised into several views of the system. The document makes use of the Krutchten 4+1 model which includes the following views:\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Logical View
\item Deployment View
\item Process View
\item Physical View
\item Scenarios
\end{itemize}

%\end{flushleft}

\section{Architecture}
This section contains a information pertaining to the 2+1 architecture selected for the FindMeTutor system.

\subsection{Type of Architecture}
The FindMeTutor system makes use of 2-Tier architecture. The application layer contains the user-interface and the business logic. The second layer contains the database ,which stores the user data for the FindMeTutor system. Below is a diagram which depicts the architecture of the system:\\\\
\includegraphics[width=140mm]{./2_Tier_Diagram.png}\\

\subsection{Advantages of 2-Tier Architecture}
\begin{itemize}
\item Allows the application to be easily devloped due to the architectures simplicity.
\item Maximum user satisfaction can be ensured due to accurate and fast prototyping of applications.
\item Fast development time due to fast prototyping and testing.
\item Database logic and business logic are physically close, which offers higher performance, (i.e.no intermediate layers between user interface layer and database layer).\\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Responsibilities of Layer 1 (Application Level):}
\begin{itemize}
\item The application layer contains the businnes logic and user interface components of the system. Layer 1 is responsible for conveying FindMeTutor services to the client. Layer 1 also contains the administration layer used to add funds to a student/tutor account as well as general configuration by an approved administrator.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Responsibilities of Layer 2:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Contains the data for the system. Allows multiple users to access the same data simultaneously.
\item Primarily regarded as the backbone of the system.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Systems of interest}
The main systems of interest is FindMeTutor which contain the following two subsystems:
\begin{itemize}
\item FindMeTutor Student Application
\item FindMeTutor Tutor Application
\item FindMeTutor SQL Server
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Supplementary Information}
The FindMeTutor system comprises of two main components: The FindMeTutor Student Application and the FindMeTutor Tutor Application. The student application is used by the students to manage anything related to a student account and the tutor application is used by the tutors to manage anything related to the tutor account. Requests for a tutor are made using the student application and responses from tutors as to whether to accept or reject the requests are made using the tutor application.

\pagebreak

\section{Architectural Goals and Constraints}
The following lists the goals and constraints of the FindMeTutor system.

\subsection{Technical Platform}
The FindMeTutor application will be deployed on the Android mobile platform. The application is made up of two parts the user interface and the businness logic. The application then communicates with a server of which the entire systems data is stored. The database system consists of an Ubuntu server running a MySql databse.\\

\subsection{Transcations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Student Transcation\\
The student would pay funds into the FindMeTutor bank account. The students email address would be used as a reference. As soon as the funds have cleared, the student is provided with a credit on the FindMeTutor system. The student can then use the credit to book and pay for tutoring sessions.

\item Tutor Transaction\\
Upon a successful tutoring session. The FindMeTutor system credits the tutor with the amount agreed upon. All of the tutors credits are added up at the end of the month and then paid out to the tutor by means of a bank transfer.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security}
The FindMeTutor system takes security very seriously. During a tutoring session the systems logs the exact GPS location of both the tutor and student at all times. Should a location not be logged by both the student and tutor. The the tutor will not receive payment and the student will receive a poor rating.Further communication with FindMeTutor will be required by the tutor to receive payment.

\subsection{Reliability/Availability (failover)}
The FindMeTutor system makes use of a failover or backup server in the event that something should go wrong. Furthermore FindMeTutor has aquired additional capacity so as to anticipate an uptake in system usage and as a result ensure the system is reliable at all times.

\pagebreak

\section{Stakeholders}
This section lists the various organisations who are concerned with the project.
\subsection{List of Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
\item Development Team (Stakeholder 1)\\
The Development team is concerned with the implementation of the system, they want to develop the system in the best possible way in the shortest time.

\item Analysts (Stakeholder 2)\\
The analysts are concerned with the design of the system, and the functionality of the system once implemented.

\item Lecturer (Stakeholder 3)\\
The Software Design lecturer is concerned with the progress of the design and implementation of the system.

\item Students (Stakeholder 4)\\
Students want a system which will address their needs as well as a functioning system which is favourable towards them finding tutors.

\item Tutors (Stakeholder 5)\\
Tutors want a system which addresses their needs as well as a functioning system which is favourable towards them as they wish to earn an income from FindMeTutor.
\end{itemize}

\pagebreak

\section{Concern and Stakeholder Traceability}
\subsection{List of Concerns}
This section identifies concers relating to the architecture of the FindMeTutor system.
\begin{itemize}
\item{Purpose of the system (Concern 1)}\\
The main purpose of the system is to provide a connection between a student and a tutor.A potential concern here would be a slow uptake or worse students are not interested in using the application.

\item Suitability of the architecture (Concern 2).\\
The 2-tier architecture selected allows the developers to modify different aspects of the system without affecting other important aspects of the system. For example: if the businness logic should change, we can simply modify the logic layer of the application while not affecting the user interface or database layers of the system.\\\\A potential concern here would be that the architecture above does not fully support certain aspects of expansion should the system experience growth and need to be expanded

\item Feasibility (Concern 3)\\
Should the system not be feasible. i.e. High costs of keeping the system running. Developers and server costs for the system would be high and FindMeTutor would need some sort of revenue to keep the system running. Scability is another issue, we need to scale in order to create revenue. A concern would be that the system does not create revenue for the upkeep of the system and hence the system is no longer feasible.

\item Evolution of the FindMeTutor system (Concern 4)\\
The system will change as time progress, the system is largely based on the users of the system. Thus as the users change, the system will have to change to match the users. A concern here would be that system does not meet the users demands/preferences and ultimately fails.


\end{itemize}

Responsibilities of Layer 1 (Application Level):
\begin{itemize}
\item The application layer contains the businnes logic and user interface. The first layer is responsible for conveying FindMeTutor services to the user. It also contains the administration layer used to add funds to a student/tutor account as well as general configuration by an approved administrator. This layer runs on the Android operating system, the application is installed on the users mobile device.
\end{itemize}

Responsibilities of Layer 2:
